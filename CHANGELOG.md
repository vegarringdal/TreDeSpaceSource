# Changelog

Newest first. Each entry is dated and marked with the `package.json` version it
lands AFTER (`>0.0.68` = unreleased on top of 0.0.68); the director bumps the
version at release time. See CLAUDE.md for the rule.

- **2026.08.28** (>0.0.68):
  Model Assets tree: EVERYTHING starts collapsed — stores and every folder
  inside them, so expanding a store shows its folders still folded — and a
  search no longer force-expands the tree. The count each row already shows
  (files beneath it) is the match count while filtering, so a search reads as
  numbers on the collapsed rows.
- **2026.08.28** (>0.0.68):
  Measurements ribbon: new "Off when ribbon switch" toggle (default on,
  persisted; hotkey `measure.offOnSwitch`, ALT+1213). Leaving the ribbon —
  clicking another ribbon tab or activating a layout slot via the Layout
  ribbon / F-keys — puts the measurement tool back to Off, so a measuring
  mode never lingers while the user works elsewhere.
- **2026.08.28** (>0.0.68):
  The Clipping ribbon's Shapes button now opens the Clip Shapes panel (docked
  right, recreating the column if it was closed away). It was wired to a
  placeholder that only logged "shapes come later". The button gained a
  tooltip and a hotkey (`clipShapes.open`, ALT+1212).
- **2026.08.28** (>0.0.68):
  Model Assets and SQL Assets trees open fully collapsed — `main` included —
  and both panels gained Collapse all / Expand all buttons with hotkeys
  (`assets.collapseAll/expandAll` ALT+1210/1211, `sql.collapseAll/expandAll`
  ALT+1208/1209). The FileTree widget got `collapseAllSignal` /
  `expandAllSignal` props (edge-triggered counters the parent bumps; the tree
  keeps owning per-folder state) plus a `dirPaths()` helper; README and the
  widget gallery updated.
- **2026.08.28** (>0.0.68):
  Settings → Shortcuts: a search bar (matches label, description, id, category
  and the current key combo; groups with hits auto-expand). All `sql.*`
  shortcuts moved from `Home` into their own `SQL` category. The SQL kill
  shortcut is rebound from ALT+637 to `END`, now fires from inside the editor
  (`allowInInput`) and only while a query is running (`context`), so END keeps
  its end-of-line meaning when idle and an idle worker is never killed. Fixes
  the kill shortcut not working: focus is in the editor when you need it, and
  hotkeys are muted in inputs unless a binding opts in.
